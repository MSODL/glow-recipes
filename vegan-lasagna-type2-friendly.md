## ⚠️ Type 2 Diabetes Considerations

### High-Glycemic Ingredients Flagged:

| Ingredient | GI Rating | Blood Sugar Impact | Recommended Action |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Gluten-free pasta noodles | **High (70+)** | ⚠️ **Significant spike** | **SWAP with zucchini slices** |
| Marinara sauce (with sugar) | **Moderate (45-50)** | ⚠️ **Moderate spike** | Use sugar-free version |

### ✅ Type 2-Friendly Modifications:

1. **🌟 MOST IMPORTANT**: Replace gluten-free pasta with **zucchini or eggplant "noodles"**
   - This reduces net carbs from **35g → 12g**
   - Changes glycemic impact from **Medium → Low**
   
2. **Use sugar-free marinara sauce** or make your own with:
   - Fresh tomatoes
   - Garlic, basil, oregano
   - No added sugar

3. **Increase vegetable ratio**:
   - Add extra spinach layers
   - Use more zucchini and mushrooms
   - Consider adding bell peppers or eggplant

4. **Add extra protein**:
   - Mix in cooked lentils (moderate GI but high fiber)
   - Add extra tofu layer

5. **Portion control**:
   - Stick to **1/8 of recipe** (one serving)
   - Pair with a **large side salad** with olive oil dressing
   - This creates a balanced meal with lower overall glycemic load

## 🔄 Substitutions

### For Lower Carb (Type 2 Optimal):
- **Pasta → Veggie Noodles**: Use spiralized zucchini, thinly sliced eggplant, or layers of large spinach leaves
  - **Result**: Net carbs drop to ~12g, GI becomes "Low"

### For Nut-Free:
- **Cashews → Silken Tofu**: Use additional 300g silken tofu instead of cashews for the ricotta
- **Cashews → Blanched Almonds**: Soak and blend almonds instead

### For Convenience:
- **Homemade Ricotta → Store-bought**: Use prepared vegan ricotta (check ingredients for added sugars)
